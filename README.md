ECE 5745 Section 5: TinyRV2 Accelerators
==========================================================================

This repository contains the code and documentation for ECE 5745 Section
5 on the RTL design of TinyRV2 accelerators. More detailed tutorials will
be posted on the public course website shortly, but this section will at
least give you a chance to write simple C applications and write some RTL
for a basic accelerator.

You can find the actual section document in the repo here:
